**swimOS** is a complete, self-contained distributed software platform for
building stateful, massively real-time streaming applications.  **swimOS**
implements a distributed microkernel, called the **Swim Kernel**, that is
persistent without a database, reactive without a message broker, autonomous
without a job manager, and which executes general purpose stateful applications
without a separate app server.

## Getting Started

Check out the [**swimOS** cookbook](https://www.swimos.org/tutorials) to learn
how to build massively real-time streaming applications.  Use the
[**Swim API**](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/ai.swim/swim-api) to write
Web Agents that run on the **Swim Kernel**.  Use the
[**Swim Server**](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/ai.swim/swim-server)
library to embed the **Swim Kernel** directly into an application, creating
a self-sufficient stateful distributed application plane.

To write WARP client applications that run in Node.js and web browsers,
install the [**@swim/mesh**](swim-system-js/swim-mesh-js) library from npm.
To build a real-time Web UI, npm install the [**@swim/ui**](swim-system-js/swim-ui-js)
and [**@swim/ux**](swim-system-js/swim-ux-js) libraries.
Visit [**swimOS.org**](https://www.swimos.org) to learn more.

## Architecture

**swimOS**, and the multiplexed streaming WARP protocol, make the World Wide
Web stateful, and massively real-time.  Massive real-time means that every
aspect of a Web application can be efficiently streamed in real-time—keeping
the whole WARP Web continuously in sync.  The **Swim Kernel** accomplishes this
by running general purpose, stateful distributed processes, called Web Agents,
that continuously communicate with each other, and with other applications,
using point-to-point multiplexed streaming APIs.  Web Agents can also natively
expose HTTP, WebSocket, and MQTT interfaces, making it easy to integrate
Web Agents into existing systems.

The architecture of **swimOS** fundamentally differs from traditional
distributed software platforms.  Instead of depending on a stack of middleware,
**swimOS** is architected like a higher order distributed operating system.
The **Swim Kernel** holistically distributes and executes all aspects of
stateful Web Agent applications, providing builtin distributed persistence,
messaging, scheduling, and multiplexed streaming APIs.

<img src="https://docs.swimos.org/readme/middleware-stack-vs-distributed-os.svg" alt="Middleware Stack vs. Distributed OS">

Vertical integration greatly simplifies application development and operations,
while radically improving performance.  CPUs are 1,000,000x+ faster than
networks.  By optimizing for data locality, and thereby eliminating numerous
superfluous network round-trips, **swimOS** slashes the time it takes to
perform many application operations from milliseconds to nanoseconds.
This performance boost doesn't trade-off scalability: **swimOS** is fully
distributed, and linearly scalable.

software platform for building stateful, massively real-time streaming
applications that run on any Java 8+ VM.  **Swim System** has no external
dependencies beyond a minimal JVM.

## Concepts

**swimOS** unifies the traditionally disparate roles of database, message broker,
job manager, and application server, into a few simple constructs: Web Agents,
Lanes, Links, and Recon.  Web Agents run like continuous, general purpose
processes on heterogeneous distributed computers, called a Fabrics.

### Web Agents
**swimOS** applications consist of interconnected, distributed objects, called
Web Agents.  Each Web Agent has URI address, like a REST endpoint. But unlike
RESTful Web Services, Web Agents are stateful, and accessed via streaming APIs.

### Lanes
If Web Agents are distributed objects, then lanes serve as the properties and
methods of those objects.  Lanes come in many flavors, value lanes, map lanes,
command lanes, and join lanes, to name a few.  Many lanes are internally
persistent, acting like encapsulated databas tables.

### Links
Distributed objects need a way to communicate.  Links establishes active
references to lanes of Web Agents, transparently streaming bi-directional state
changes to keep all parts of an application in sync, without the overhead of
queries or remote procedure calls.

### Recon
Communication only works if all parties understands one another.  **swimOS**
natively speaks a universal, structured data language, called Recon. A superset
of JSON, XML, Protocol Buffers, and more, Recon naturally translates into many
tongues.

### Fabrics
**swimOS** serves as the higher order operating system for distributed computers,
called Fabrics, which **swimOS** coherently stitches together from non-uniformly
distributed, heterogeneous sets of machines.
